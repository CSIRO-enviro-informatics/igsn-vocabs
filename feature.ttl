.

sft:interval a skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "Interval" ;
  skos:definition "A discrete segment along a longer path in which an observation or specimen is collected over the distance between the upper and lower bounds of the interval. A Depth Interval is a sub-type of Interval"@en ;
  skos:topConceptOf feature: ;
.

sft:observationWell a skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "Observation well" ;
  skos:definition "A hole or shaft constructed in the earth intended to be used to locate, sample, or develop groundwater, oil, gas, or some other subsurface material. The diameter of a well is typically much smaller than the depth. Wells are also used to artificially recharge groundwater or to pressurize oil and gas production zones. Specific kinds of wells should be specified in the SamplingFeature description. For example, underground waste-disposal wells should be classified as waste injection wells"@en ;

sft:profile a skos:Concept ;
  skos:prefLabel "Profile" ;
  skos:definition "A one-dimensional grid at fixed (x, y, t) coordinates within a four-dimensional (x, y, z, t) coordinate reference system. The grid axis is aligned with the coordinate reference system z-axis. Typically used to characterize or measure phenomena as a function of depth"@en ;

  skos:prefLabel "Site" ;
  skos:definition "A facility or location at which observations have been collected. A site may have instruments or equipment installed and may contain multiple other sampling features (e.g., a stream gage, weather station, observation well, etc.). Additionally, many specimen sampling features may be collected at a site. Sites are also often referred to as stations. A site is represented as a point, but it may have a geographical footprint that is not a point. The site coordinates serve as a reference for the site and offsets may be specified from this reference location"@en ;
